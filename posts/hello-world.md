Hi ðŸ‘‹ there!, this is the first post that will be part of a series in which we will illustrate the entire process of creating higgsboson. Probably the first thing you notice is that my level of English is not native and that makes you uncomfortable, I am very sorry if this is the case but I thought it would be useful, even though it is not the language I speak, to write the posts in this way, you learn about the process, I learn to express myself in written English by practicing.

```js
// Comment
export function SayHelloWorld (data) {
  return `Hello World`;
}

SayHelloWorld();
```

Long life and prosperity ðŸ––, see you in the next post.
